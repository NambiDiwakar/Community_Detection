# Community_Detection

Implementing hierarchical bottom-up clustering on real life data using Modularity function.

Based on the survey paper given by :Complex Networks and Systems Lagrange Laboratory, ISI Foundation, Viale S. Severo 65, 10133, Torino, I-ITALY

Implemented hierarchial bottom-up clustering algortihm using Equation(15) in the survey paper. with the help of equation we can compute modularity.

Starting with cluster size one, repeatedly find the pair whose merger gives maximum modularity and we can merge it.

we can find number of communities equals to some value k (k can be 1,2,3,....)
